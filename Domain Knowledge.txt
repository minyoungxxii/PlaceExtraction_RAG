(Knowledge Base for RAG-based Place Inference)

1. Introduction

For robots to collaborate naturally with humans in residential or office environments, it is essential to understand the relationship between places and objects. Specific places repeatedly contain characteristic objects, and such object patterns serve as strong cues for identifying spaces. This document organizes domain knowledge of household and office environments, mapping detailed places to object sets, for use in RAG-based semantic place inference.
